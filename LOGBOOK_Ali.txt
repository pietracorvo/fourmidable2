# CURRENT TODOs AND STUFF CONCERNING 3DMOKE CODE ON FOURMIDABLE


OPEN TODOs:
- redo hallprobe calibration
- integrate nanocube stage
- integrate quantalux
- understand the PID



2024-04-02:
    - rewired hexapole consistently, redone magent calibration
    - cleanup magnet calibration, moved data, results and plots to data/results_magnet_calibration

2024-04-02:
    - leaving the calibration for the senis as is (xyz -> -xzy)
      adding a -135deg rotation in calibration class to move to table FOR

2024-04-02:
    - start to change code for hallprobe calibration

2024-03-28:
    - not HallprobeC is wrong cabled, but current trough PoleC runs in wrong handedness
    - applied magnet calibration successfully (with switched kepco C output cable)
    - first tests with senis, confirmed FoR, verified wrong current handedness in poleC

2024-03-26:
    - HallsensorC gives switched polarity compared to other sensors
        other sensors give negative output voltage for positive current input to magnet (like in 3DMoke)
    - applied magnet calibration successfully


2024-03-25:
    - to get a positive kepco output for positive kepco input signal (like in 3DMoke), the input cables polarity has been switched temporairly
        -> for later: change polarity in NIcard output box and switch kepco input cables back


2024-03-21:
    - to generate the file for the MagnetHystCalib you have to run the following scripts and notebooks
        1) testing\collecting_degauss.py
            creates degauss_signal.h5 file
        2) experiments\calibration\magnetic_minor_loop.py
            creates hex_minor_Ichannel.h5 with fits of loops
        3) experiments\calibration\RL_circuit_testing.py for every pole
            (NOTE connect cable in paralell to kepco output to measure voltage as instrument "v_measurement" )
            creates rl_response_data_poleX.h5
            3.1) magnet_calibration_insteps\getting_rl_fft.ipynb
                creates rl_coeff.p from rl_response_data_poleX.h5
        4) now run magnet_calibration_insteps\inverse_hyst_fitting.ipynb to process and join the files from 1)-3)
            creates


2024-03-19:
    - found documentation of 3DMoke


2024-03-13:
    - Calibration: understanding how calibration of the hallprobes and magnets works, on what it relies, etc.
        -> look into experiments
    - Hallprobes: having clock Dev1/aiXX gives a ~2.5V offset (???)
    - Stage: replace smaract stage code with our stage
        NOTE before the smaract stagethe Fourmidable PI stage was used, so probably there is still some code around from it
    - laser button currently commented
    - "reference" instrument on AO seems to be needed for deGauss, find out what it is and does
    - incorporate quantalux gui
