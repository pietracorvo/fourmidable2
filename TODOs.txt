CURRENT TODOs CONCERNING FOURMIDABLE




2024-03-13:
    - Calibration: understanding how calibration of the hallprobes and magnets works, on what it relies, etc.
        -> look into experiments
    - Hallprobes: having clock Dev1/aiXX gives a ~2.5V offset (???)
    - Stage: replace smaract stage code with our stage
    - laser button currently commented
    - "reference" instrument on AO seems to be needed for deGauss, find out what it is and does
