# CURRENT TODOs AND STUFF CONCERNING 3DMOKE CODE ON FOURMIDABLE


2024-03-19:
    - found documentation of 3DMoke

2024-03-13:
    - Calibration: understanding how calibration of the hallprobes and magnets works, on what it relies, etc.
        -> look into experiments
    - Hallprobes: having clock Dev1/aiXX gives a ~2.5V offset (???)
    - Stage: replace smaract stage code with our stage
        NOTE before the smaract stagethe Fourmidable PI stage was used, so probably there is still some code around from it
    - laser button currently commented
    - "reference" instrument on AO seems to be needed for deGauss, find out what it is and does
    - incorporate quantalux gui
